<b>1.0 Introduction</b>

Over the past few decades, wildfires have burned millions of hectares of forest across British Columbia (BC), devastating the landscape. Notably, the four most severe wildfire seasons occurred in 2017, 2018, 2021, and 2023 (Parisien et al., 2023). Wildfires significantly impact ecosystems, including biodiversity, habitats, water systems, and human settlements (Haider et al., 2019). Additionally, the smoke from these fires severely affects air quality over vast distances (Douglas-Vail et al., 2023).
BC's complex topography encompasses diverse ecosystems and climates, characterized by variations in elevation, temperature, and vegetation. These environmental differences lead to significant spatial variations in wildfire intensity and extent (Meyn et al., 2013). Examining environmental factors at a spatial resolution that reflects this diversity is crucial to avoid obscuring these variations (Meyn et al., 2013). However, wildfire prediction and management remain challenging due to limited understanding of wildfires' roles in the Earth's system (Liu et al., 2024).

In BC, the area burned by wildfires appears to depend more strongly on precipitation than temperature (Meyn et al., 2013). Since precipitation patterns are inherently difficult to predict, projecting changes in wildfire severity in BC introduces greater uncertainties compared to regions where temperature is the primary limiting factor (Meyn et al., 2013). Therefore, it is vital to analyze fire-climate relationships at high spatial resolutions to capture variability in precipitation and temperature and their effects on wildfire extent (Meyn et al., 2013). Understanding whether temperature or precipitation plays a more significant role in wildfire severity is key to improving predictions and management strategies in BC (Meyn et al., 2013).

The wildfire seasons of 2017 and 2018 were among the worst in recent decades, with 1,216,053 hectares and 1,354,284 hectares burned, respectively. In stark contrast, 2019 saw a 98% decrease in burned area, with only 21,138 hectares affected. This raises the question: what made 2019 so different from the preceding two years?
This study seeks to deepen the understanding of the relationship between wildfires and climate by examining differences in climate conditions during 2017, 2018, and 2019. The goal is to determine whether temperature or precipitation played a greater role in the significant reduction of wildfire activity in 2019.
